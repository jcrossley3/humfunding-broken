* ODH HumFunding
Humanities faculty funding application, particularly an admin view

- Connects to the ODH account's Formstack API to retrieve data on applicants
- Uses Apache FOP to generate the ASB's desired form sheets 

generated using Luminus version "2.9.10.44"

** Prerequisites

You will need [[https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen][Leiningen]] 2.0 or above installed.

** Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
	lein run
#+END_SRC

Hot-coding (the way web dev was meant to be), where you don't need to hit your browser's refresh button, can then be started with:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
	lein figwheel
#+END_SRC

Finally, getting auto-compilation of your style sheets (so style changes are also instantly manifested) occurs with:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
	lein garden auto
#+END_SRC

** FUTURE WORK
- [ ] Persistent Selector for dropdown
- [ ] More than just leave requests
- [ ] (far in the future) review of submissions by applicants
